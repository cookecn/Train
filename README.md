# About
The Train assignment has us creating a website that utilizes firebase's functionality to send and receive information from a database. The user will input a train name, the trains destination, when it departs, and how often. The information will be passed through firebase and then back in to a table that shows this information. It will then use moment.js to determine the next train in relevance to the current time and when the train is supposed to arrive, as well as the next available train.
